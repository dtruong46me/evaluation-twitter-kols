## Problem Description

Evaluation of Twitter Account Quality for KOLs in the Web3 Space. In Web3 marketing, Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) on social media platforms like Twitter are crucial for driving trends, building communities, and shaping opinions. This project aims to develop a robust framework to assess the quality of Twitter accounts operated by KOLs in the Web3 space, providing insights into their influence, effectiveness, engagement, and credibility. 

**Requirements:**

- Identification of KOL Twitter Accounts: Compile a comprehensive list of Twitter accounts belonging to KOLs being actively involved in the Web3 space.  

- Data Collection Workflows: Develop and implement automated workflows for collecting relevant data from Twitter. 

- Deployment of Machine Learning, AI, and Deep Learning Models: Utilize advanced techniques in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning to evaluate the quality of each KOL's Twitter account.


## Objective

The project aims to create a system that assesses the quality of Twitter accounts operated by Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) in the Web3 space. The goal is to provide actionable insights into their influence, engagement, credibility, and effectiveness in driving Web3 marketing trends and building communities.


## Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- **Ingestion:**
  - Twitter API (real-time streaming data).
  - Kafka streams Twitter data for real-time processing.

- **Orchestration:**
  - Apache NiFi automates workflows for raw data collection and pushes it to storage.

- **Storage:**
  - Raw data stored in HDFS for further processing.

### 2. Data Processing
- **Batch Processing:**
  - Use Apache Spark to clean, preprocess, and transform data (e.g., removing noise, feature extraction).
  - Save processed data in a structured format (e.g., Parquet) for efficient querying.

- **Real-Time Processing:**
  - Apache Flink analyzes streaming Twitter data for real-time insights.

- **Data Enrichment:**
  - Use external APIs (e.g., sentiment analysis services) to enhance raw data with additional features like sentiment and topic tags.

### 3. Machine Learning & Analysis
- **Data Preparation & Training:**
  - Spark pipelines create labeled datasets for supervised learning.

- **ML Models:**
  - Deploy deep learning models (using TensorFlow or PyTorch) for advanced tasks like sentiment analysis, fake account detection, and topic modeling.
  - Use MLlib for scalable influence scoring models.

- **Evaluation:**
  - Use distributed tools to validate models and compute results.
  - Save model outputs in storage for visualization.


### 4. Data Visualization
- **Backend API:**
  - Serve processed data and model insights using APIs (e.g., FastAPI, Flask).

- **Dashboard:**
  - Build dashboards using Tableau, Superset, or Grafana.
  - Visualize KOL rankings, engagement trends, and network graphs.

- **Real-Time Updates:**
  - Integrate real-time metrics and updates using Grafana connected to Kafka or Flink.

### 5. Deployment & Monitoring
- **Deployment:**
  - Use Kubernetes to containerize and deploy the entire pipeline.
  - Deploy ML models using TensorFlow Serving or TorchServe.

- **Monitoring:**
  - Use Prometheus for collecting metrics on system health.
  - Visualize metrics using Grafana for debugging and optimization.
