## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing Twitter accounts of **Key Opinion Leaders** (KOLs) in the **"Web3 space"** to determine their impact and quality. Letâ€™s break down the main components:

+ **Identify Web3 KOLs:** Start by creating a list of Twitter accounts of individuals who have significant influence in Web3. These people drive trends, discussions, and opinions in blockchain, cryptocurrency, NFTs, and decentralized technologies.

+ **Data Collection:** Develop automated workflows to pull data from these accounts, which might include follower count, engagement metrics (likes, retweets, comments), posting frequency, and types of content shared.

+ **Machine Learning Models:** Use ML and AI to analyze this data for patterns that indicate quality. For example:
  + Influence and Effectiveness: Measure how well their content spreads and influences their followers.
  + Engagement: Look at interactions (likes, retweets) as a proxy for how active and engaging their followers are.
  + Credibility: Evaluate account authenticity to differentiate genuine influence from bots or spammy activity.

In summary, the objective is to build a framework to score or rank these Twitter accounts based on their real impact and engagement in the **"Web3 space"**. This involves data collection, AI-based analysis, and a scoring model to provide meaningful insights.
